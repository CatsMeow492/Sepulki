## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone/setup the repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CatsMeow492/Sepulki.git
git checkout -b main  # or update existing branch

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Development Environment
```bash
# Start infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, InfluxDB)
npm run docker:up

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access Points
- **Forge UI**: http://localhost:3000 (when started)
- **GraphQL API**: http://localhost:4000/graphql
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001 (sepulki / vault_dev_key)
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (smith / forge_dev)

## 🔐 Default Credentials

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@sepulki.com`
- Password: `admin123` ⚠️ **Change in production!**

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

- **GraphQL** - Single API endpoint with flexible queries
- **PostgreSQL** - Robust relational database with JSONB support
- **Redis** - Fast caching and session storage
- **Isaac Sim** - Professional-grade physics simulation

### Brand Integration
- **Consistent Metallurgy Theme** - All services and concepts use smithing terminology
- **Professional Naming** - Clear, memorable service names (Hammer, Forge, Anvil)
- **Semantic API Design** - Operations named after metallurgy processes (Cast, Temper, Quench)

### Security Approach
- **JWT Tokens** - Stateless authentication with Redis sessions
- **Role-based Access** - Granular permissions system
- **API Gateway Pattern** - Centralized authentication and authorization
