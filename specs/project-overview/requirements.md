# Requirements — 3D Renderer for Robotics Specs (MVP)

This document captures Phase 1 (Requirements Gathering) for a minimal, demo-ready, browser-based 3D renderer that allows customers to preview robot designs and motion. It focuses on the fastest path to a working demo using Three.js/React Three Fiber, glTF 2.0 assets, and URDF for link/joint hierarchy.

## MVP User Stories
- As a customer reviewer, I want to load a proposed robot design and preview its 3D geometry and movements, so that I can validate basic fit and reach before delivery.
- As a robotics engineer, I want to convert a structured robot spec into URDF with referenced glTF meshes, so that I can visualize articulated mechanisms in the browser quickly.
- As a customer approver, I want to play a motion profile and scrub the timeline, so that I can confirm the basic cycle visually.
- As a customer reviewer, I want to adjust joint angles and speeds interactively, so that I can explore reach and joint limits.
- As a robotics engineer, I want joint limits enforced and highlighted, so that users cannot create invalid poses.
- As a support engineer, I want clear, non-fatal errors for missing assets or invalid fields, so that the demo can proceed with partial content.

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS format)
System name: “Artifex 3D Renderer”.

### Loading and Rendering
- Ubiquitous requirement: The Artifex 3D Renderer shall load a robot model from URDF with referenced glTF 2.0 assets and render an articulated scene.
- Event-driven requirement: When a valid robot spec is provided, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall generate or ingest URDF, resolve mesh references, and display the assembled model.
- Unwanted-behavior requirement: If any referenced mesh fails to load, then the Artifex 3D Renderer shall display a visible placeholder for the missing part and surface a non-blocking error message.
- Ubiquitous requirement: The Artifex 3D Renderer shall support orbit, pan, zoom, and a default camera preset for model inspection.
- Optional feature requirement: Where developer toggles are exposed, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall show/hide joint axes and frames.

### Kinematics and Motion
- Event-driven requirement: When a joint angle is changed by the user, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall update the corresponding link transforms within 33 ms (≈30 FPS) and clamp to configured limits.
- Ubiquitous requirement: The Artifex 3D Renderer shall support forward kinematics driven by joint positions specified in the spec or UI.
- Event-driven requirement: When the user presses Play on a motion profile, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall execute the profile deterministically and allow pausing and timeline scrubbing.
- Unwanted-behavior requirement: If a commanded joint exceeds its limit, then the Artifex 3D Renderer shall prevent the move and indicate the violating joint in a warning state.
- Event-driven requirement: When the timeline is scrubbed, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall render the corresponding pose without temporal overshoot.

### Interaction and UI
- Ubiquitous requirement: The Artifex 3D Renderer shall provide UI controls for joint sliders, play/pause, playback speed, and reset view.
- Event-driven requirement: When the user resets the view, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall return the camera to the default preset.

### Validation and Errors
- Event-driven requirement: When URDF or glTF validation fails, the Artifex 3D Renderer shall report concise, structured errors indicating the failing element (file, link, joint, or field).
- Unwanted-behavior requirement: If a critical error prevents rendering, then the Artifex 3D Renderer shall present a clear error state with a retry action, without crashing the host page.

### Performance and Determinism
- Ubiquitous requirement: The Artifex 3D Renderer shall maintain an interactive frame rate of ≥30 FPS on the target reference device for models within MVP limits.
- State-driven requirement: While running a motion profile (without physics), the Artifex 3D Renderer shall produce deterministic poses for a given input profile across supported browsers.

## Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP (can be added post-demo)
- Physics (collisions, gravity, stability, center-of-mass)
- Approvals workflow, audit records, shareable links, authentication/authorization
- Mobile-optimized UI, accessibility enhancements (beyond basic keyboard focus), reduced-motion modes
- Advanced visualization toggles (bounds, COM, clearances), complex materials/post-processing
- Extensive logging/telemetry and export artifacts (video/thumbnail)
