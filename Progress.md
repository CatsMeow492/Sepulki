# 🔥 Sepulki Development Progress

**Focus: Quality-First, Test-Driven Development**

## 🎬 **Demo Story: Complete Robot Design Pipeline**

### **The Narrative Flow**
```
Customer Journey: "I need warehouse automation" → Working robot deployed

1. 🧠 ANALYZE: "I need a robot to pick items from shelves"
   → AI analyzes requirements using real component catalog
   → Suggests specific Alloys (motors, grippers, controllers)
   → Recommends Pattern (Industrial Arm - 6DOF)

2. 🔧 FORGE: Interactive 3D robot design
   → Load suggested components in 3D viewer  
   → Adjust joint parameters and reach
   → Test motion profiles (pick, place, rotate)
   → Real-time validation (collision, limits, feasibility)

3. 💾 SAVE: Forge new Sepulka (robot design)
   → Save to database with specifications
   → Generate unique Sepulka ID and version
   → Link selected Alloys to design

4. 🏭 CAST: Build deployable artifact (Ingot)
   → Generate URDF from design specification
   → Package 3D assets and configuration
   → Create signed, versioned build artifact
   → Store in Vault (MinIO) for deployment

5. 🚀 DEPLOY: Quench to Fleet
   → Select target fleet for deployment
   → Deploy Ingot to robot hardware
   → Update fleet status and robot assignments
   → Monitor deployment progress

6. 📊 MONITOR: Live fleet dashboard
   → Real-time robot status and telemetry
   → Task assignment and execution monitoring
   → Performance analytics and health scores
```

### **Demo Script (5-minute pitch)**
```
"Watch me design and deploy a warehouse robot in 5 minutes:

[ANALYZE] 'I need warehouse automation for 50lb packages'
→ AI suggests ServoMax Pro 3000 + GripForce Elite + VisionEye 4K

[FORGE] Configure robot in 3D
→ Adjust reach to 1.5m, payload to 50lb, precision to 0.5mm
→ Test pick-and-place motion - looks good!

[SAVE] Save as 'WarehouseBot-Production-v1'
→ Stored in database, ready to build

[BUILD] Cast Ingot - generating deployment package
→ URDF generated, assets packaged, build signed

[DEPLOY] Deploy to 'Warehouse-A' fleet  
→ 3 robots updated with new design
→ All robots now running the new configuration

[MONITOR] Live dashboard shows:
→ 3 robots active, 95% efficiency
→ Pick rate: 12 items/minute
→ Zero errors, 89% battery average

That's robotics-as-a-service: Design → Deploy → Monitor"
```
